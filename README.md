# Bollywood America Website

This app uses Middleman. To run locally:

1. `git clone`
2. `middleman`

To compile a build and deploy

1. `git clone`
2. `middleman build`
3. The `build` contains an index.html and some static assets. Put them on your favorite host or serve them up with a server of your choice!


# Deploy

To deploy, get a FTP client like Filezilla and connect to `bollywoodamerica.net` with the user name and password and deploy to `public_html`/. Priya and Mehul have the log in credentials.

# TODO

Make `middleman-deploy` work. It should be pretty easy, but isn't working.
