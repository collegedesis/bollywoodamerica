  position: "Co-Director, Registration & Hospitality Manager, Mixer Manager"
  bio: "What would we do without Priya, our board mom and master organizer? She’s currently in grad school prepping to become a therapist and is a UC Berkeley alum (she can’t wait for Bollywood America to return to her old stomping grounds in the Bay this year). If she looks familiar, you may have seen her tear up the stage with Berkeley Ishaara on America’s Got Talent! She’s living the Bollywood dream and still dances professionally, travelling the country to perform with Ishaara Dance"

- officer:
  name: Rohan Patel
  email_address: rbpatel4@gmail.com
  position: "Co-Director, Venue & Tech Manager, Operations & Logistics Manager"
  bio: "They call him King Tut, but you can call him SRK…he’s got the moves, the look, the charm, and the cheesiness, he just has to lean right, stick one hand out, one through his hair, and he’s a star. Rohan’s been on board since Bollywood America’s first year, but his stardom began with his 5-year UCLA Nashaa and Raas stints in 2005. He still dances, enjoys kicking around a soccer ball in his free time, and is excited for craziness to ensue at Bollywood America; when you bring together all forms of dance in the ultimate competition, anything is possible."

  name: Karishma Shah
  email_address: kshah124@gmail.com
  position: "Producer, Creative Manager, Marketing & Publicity Manager, Global Sponsorship Manager"
  bio: "A dancer at heart, when Karishma isn’t jet-setting from San Francisco or working on the next crazy Google [x] project as Google [x]’s youngest hire, she’s cutely smiling and dancing her way through life to a soundtrack in her head or thinking of another production stunt to make Bollywood America’s 5th year the best yet. She was on a Bollywood dance troupe in high school, captained UPenn’s Raas team, and was on the founding board of RAASadelphia. Oh, and she was on TV, won a Global Entrepreneurship Week Award, and rang the NYSE opening bell for her startup, SkillHubs. NBD."

  bio: "Hiiiiii:) My name is Saba and I am a junior at University of California, Berkeley studying Molecular Cell Biology and Public Health! I grew up in Orange County, went to high school in Sacramento, and now am living it up in the Bay Area (so excited for this years BA location!) and love that I grew up all over California. My favorite past times would have be to meet new people, try new experiences, & eat new food but I'm also a homebody too that likes to just watch TV shows or chat. Lowkey used to be a major bookworm and hoping to adapt that hobby again :) As far as dance goes, I did a liiiiittle bit of hip-hop and jazz during highschool and have some experience with classical Bengali dance when I was younger. Bollywood movies have ALWAYS been an obsession of mine, however, I never actually knew about the collegiate HFD dance circuit until I came to Berkeley but I was literally immediately captivated by how large, entertaining, serious, and fun it all seemed! BA IS ABOUT TO BE DOPE, pumped for this year and can't wait to put on an awesome show :D"

  email_address: promakhosla@gmail.com
  position: "Marketing & Publicity Globalizer"

Proma has danced her whole life and intends to continue that tradition, especially since she's addicted to Bollywood movies. She also watches way too much TV, but that's okay because she plans to move to New York this fall and start working in the entertainment industry. Go BA and forever go Blue."
